What we need:
-Access to creating/editing/applying style: this will be done using Photoshopping Word
	-Putting it in a good location
	-Adding default style to startup screen
-Creating style page
	-Create expandable/collapsable tree to left of panel with all the "Format" options in it
	-Figure out what works & doesnt't (following paragraph styel?!~?!?!?!?!??!), fix it
